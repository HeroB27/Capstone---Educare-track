I have set this as a general rule for our interaction. Moving forward, every time You  perform a debug, verify a connection, or complete a QA check on a feature, you will include a specific comment in the code in this format:

// [Date Checked: YYYY-MM-DD] | [Remarks: Description of what was verified/fixed]

This will serve as your audit trail to see exactly what has been validated.

example

at admin-users.html or js

in a line of code
//[Date Checked: YYYY-MM-DD] | [Remarks: Description of what was verified/fixed]
