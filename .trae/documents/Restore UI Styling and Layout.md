# Fix Broken UI (Restore Styling)

The screenshot shows exactly what happened: the "Tailwind CSS" engine is missing. Without it, all the layout and colors are gone, leaving just plain HTML. This happened because I accidentally omitted the Tailwind script tag during the last stability update.

## 1. Restore the Styling Engine
- I will add back the Tailwind CSS script tag to [index.html](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/Educare%20Track%20-%20FINAL/index.html).
- I will use a **highly reliable CDN** (jsDelivr) to ensure it bypasses any privacy extension blocks.

## 2. UI Refresh
- Once the script is restored, the page will instantly return to its professional, violet-themed design.
- I will also ensure the "Safety Shield" logic is properly wrapped so it doesn't interfere with the visual loading.

## 3. Verification
- After I make this change, you will simply need to **refresh the page**. The layout will be back to normal immediately.

**I am restoring the styles now. You will see the violet dashboard again in 30 seconds!**
