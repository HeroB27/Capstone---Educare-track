I will proceed with the following Strict Implementation Plan to fix the broken scanners and enforce the read-only school name:

1. **Scanner Library Fix (Critical)**:

   * **Action**: Download the `jsQR` library (v1.4.0) and save it to `core/jsQR.js`. This is required because `core/qr-camera.js` depends on it, but it is currently missing from the project.

   * **Action**: Update `guard/guard-scanner.html`, `clinic/clinic-scanner.html`, and `teacher/teacher-gatekeeper-scanner.html` to:

     * Remove the incorrect `<script src="...html5-qrcode..."></script>`.

     * Add `<script src="../core/jsQR.js"></script>`.

2. **Enforce Fixed School Name**:

   * **Action**: Modify `admin/admin-settings.html` to change the "School Name" field from an editable `<input>` to a **read-only display element** (e.g., a text span or disabled input), strictly following the "NOT EDITABLE" rule.

3. **Verification**:

   * I will verify the files are updated correctly.

   * (You can then reload the page to see the fixed scanner and read-only settings).
