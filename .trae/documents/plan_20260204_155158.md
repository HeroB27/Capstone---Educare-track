I have analyzed the current codebase (`core/theme.css`, `core/shell.js`, `core/ui.js`) and designed a comprehensive plan to implement your "Enhanced Dashboard Design".

### **Plan Overview**
The goal is to transform the current functional UI into a "premium startup-style" interface with distinct themes for each user role (Admin, Guard, Parent, Clinic, Teacher).

#### **Phase 1: Visual Foundation (Theming)**
We will overhaul `core/theme.css` to introduce the new design tokens:
*   **Role-Specific Palettes**: Define deep violet (Admin), warm amber (Guard), emerald (Parent), coral red (Clinic), and cobalt blue (Teacher).
*   **Gradients**: Create CSS variables for multi-stop gradients (e.g., `--gradient-admin`, `--gradient-card-hover`).
*   **Glassmorphism & Shadows**: Add `.glass-panel` and `.shadow-glow` utility classes.
*   **Typography**: Ensure `Space Grotesk` (headings) and `Inter` or `sans-serif` (body) are applied with the requested spacing.

#### **Phase 2: App Shell (Navigation & Layout)**
We will update `core/shell.js` to implement the new "Left Sidebar" and "Header" specs:
*   **Sidebar**: Switch to a dark-themed sidebar with user-type-specific colored icons and a collapsed profile card.
*   **Header**: Enhance the top bar with glassmorphism and gradient action buttons.
*   **Dynamic Theming**: Ensure the shell automatically switches themes based on the logged-in user's role.

#### **Phase 3: Reusable Dashboard Components**
We will extend `core/ui.js` with new "smart" components to ensure consistency:
*   `createKPICard({ icon, value, label, trend, color })`: Generates the vibrant gradient cards with sparklines.
*   `createChartContainer({ title, type, color })`: A standardized container for charts with the "soft off-white" aesthetic.
*   `createWelcomeBanner({ name, role })`: A personalized greeting section with date pickers.

#### **Phase 4: Dashboard Page Implementation**
We will refactor the dashboard logic (starting with `admin/admin-dashboard.js` as the prototype) to use the new components:
1.  **Header**: Welcome banner + Quick Actions.
2.  **KPI Row**: 4-6 gradient cards.
3.  **Charts**: Split view (e.g., Attendance Trends vs. User Distribution).
4.  **Widgets**: Activity Feed and System Status.

### **Verification**
*   I will verify the design by starting the local server and checking the Admin dashboard.
*   I will ensure the color themes correctly switch when simulating different user roles.

**Confirm to proceed with editing `core/theme.css`, `core/shell.js`, and `core/ui.js`.**
