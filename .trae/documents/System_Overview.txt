EDUCARE TRACK – USER-CENTRIC SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Core Idea:
The system revolves around all users—Admin, Teachers, Parents, Guards, and Clinic staff. Every module, workflow, and feature is designed based on user role, interactions, and responsibilities.

1. Users as the Core
User Role	Core Responsibilities	System Access
Admin	Manages users, classes, subjects, IDs, calendar, tap-in/out rules, announcements	Full CRUD access to all tables, analytics dashboards, settings
Teacher	Homeroom & subject attendance, student performance view, class announcements, clinic passes, optional gatekeeper	Limited CRUD: subject/class assignments, attendance logs, clinic passes
Parent	View child attendance, tap-in/out status, upload excuse letters, receive notifications	Read-only for child data, create excuse letters
Guard (Gatekeeper)	Scan student IDs at entry/exit points, update student status	Limited create on tap_logs, read student info for scanning
Clinic Staff	Approve clinic passes, log student visits, update status, notify parents/teachers	Limited CRUD on clinic_visits, clinic_passes, notifications

Central Concept:
All workflows—attendance, notifications, IDs, analytics—are triggered by user actions and reflected in student data. Students are the primary entity linked to every user.

2. Student-Centric Flow

Student entity connects all users:

Linked to Parents

Assigned to Classes

Tracks Homeroom & Subject Attendance

Assigned IDs with QR codes

Monitored for tap-in/out status

Can generate notifications (attendance, clinic, alerts)

Example:

Parent uploads excuse → linked to student → teacher validates → attendance updated → admin dashboard updates → Python analytics recompute trends → notifications sent

3. Core Modules Around Users
A. Dashboard

Admin sees all students & roles

Teacher sees own class students

Parent sees own children

Guard sees students at gate

Clinic sees students in clinic

B. User Management

Admin CRUD on all users

Links students → parents

Assign teachers → classes & subjects

Naming conventions enforce role + year + unique ID

C. Class & Subject Management

Teachers assigned by admin

Subjects shown via dropdown filtered by grade/strand

Homeroom teacher always first subject

Teachers view individual student attendance

Admin sees class performance analytics

D. Attendance

Homeroom & subject attendance tracked per student

Tap-in/out logs for students

Status automatically computed using attendance rules

Python computes trends, alerts, CSV exports

E. Notifications

All user actions (tap-in/out, clinic visit, announcements, excuses) trigger notifications

Sent to relevant users (parents, teachers, admin, guards, clinic)

F. IDs

Each student assigned ID + QR code

Admin manages creation, re-issue

G. School Calendar

Admin manages holidays/emergency suspensions

Impacts attendance, notifications

4. Analytics & Python

Focused on student-centered metrics

Tracks:

Attendance %

Critical absences

Frequent late

Class-level trends

Python handles computation, CSV export, alerts

5. Tap-in/Out & Attendance Logic

Users involved: Student, Guard, Teacher (gatekeeper)

System records:

Tap-in → on-time, late, partial

Tap-out → early, late, partial

Updates student’s current_status and homeroom attendance

Notifications sent automatically to Parents & Teachers

6. Central Principles

All modules revolve around users and students

Students are the anchor entity

Actions by any user reflect in student attendance & status

Simplicity first: clear flows from user action → database → dashboards/notifications → analytics

Security via Supabase Auth & RLS ensures users only see their relevant data

✅ Key Insight:
The system is a user-centered LMS:

Admin: manages and oversees

Teacher: executes class-based functions

Parent: monitors & interacts with their children

Guard: enforces access control

Clinic: manages student health
All converge on the student entity for attendance, notifications, and analytics.
