I have audited the system and confirmed that **all features** (including the new "Clinic Pass" workflow) are implemented and the **Premium UI** is applied across all dashboards.

Since you requested **not to re-seed** the database, I will perform a **Non-Destructive Health Check** to identify and fix any "crazy" data inconsistencies (like missing IDs or unlinked accounts) that might have resulted from previous editor issues.

### **Plan: System Health Check & Fix**

1.  **Create & Run Health Check Script (`scripts/check-health.mjs`)**:
    -   **Scan Students**: Identify any students missing `student_ids` (QR codes).
    -   **Scan Classes**: Check for classes without assigned `homeroom_teacher_id`.
    -   **Scan Parents**: Check for parent accounts with no linked students.
    -   **Scan Staff**: Ensure all staff (Teachers, Guards, Clinic) have valid accounts.

2.  **Fix Identified Issues (Additive Only)**:
    -   **Generate Missing IDs**: If any students lack QR codes, I will generate them using the standard `EDU-YYYY-XXXX` format.
    -   **Report Gaps**: I will list any classes missing teachers or parents missing children so you can fix them in the Admin UI.

3.  **Final UI Verification**:
    -   I will verify that the **Teacher Dashboard** correctly shows the "Issue Clinic Pass" button (confirmed in code).
    -   I will verify that the **Clinic Dashboard** shows pending passes (confirmed in code).

This approach ensures "every feature is implemented" and working correctly **without wiping your existing data**.

**Shall I proceed with the Health Check?**
