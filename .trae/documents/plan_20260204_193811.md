I have identified the issue. The project uses a **Service Worker** (`service-worker.js`) that aggressively caches your HTML, CSS, and JS files ("Cache First" strategy). This means your browser is serving the *old* files from its internal cache instead of loading your new edits from the server.

To fix this permanently for development, I will modify the Service Worker to **disable caching when running on localhost**.

### **Plan:**
1.  **Update `service-worker.js`**:
    -   Increment the cache version (to `v7.0.2`) to force the browser to install the new worker.
    -   Add logic to detect if the app is running on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
    -   If on localhost, force the "Network First" strategy for all requests, ensuring you always see your latest changes.

### **Action Required from You (After I apply the fix):**
You will need to do a **Hard Refresh** once to load the new Service Worker:
-   **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
-   **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

Shall I proceed with modifying `service-worker.js`?
