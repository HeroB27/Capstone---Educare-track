# Refine Admin Features

I will perform a series of high-impact refinements to the Admin modules to make them more professional and functional.

## 1. Class Management Refinements
I will enhance the [admin-classes.html](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/Educare%20Track%20-%20FINAL/pages/admin-classes.html) and [admin-classes.js](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/Educare%20Track%20-%20FINAL/js/admin-classes.js) with:
- **Edit Class Feature**: Add an "Edit" button to class cards to modify the Room Number and Adviser without deleting the class.
- **Student Transfer**: In the "View Students" modal, I will add a "Transfer" button for each student, allowing admins to quickly move them to a different grade/class.
- **Enhanced Schedule UI**: Improve the subject scheduling layout with better time validation and a more compact design.

## 2. User Management & Profiles
I will update [admin-users.js](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/Educare%20Track%20-%20FINAL/js/admin-users.js) to include:
- **Student Quick View**: A new modal that shows a summary of a student's **Total Attendance %**, **Recent Clinic Visits**, and **Parent Contact Info** without leaving the User Management page.
- **Batch Status Toggle**: Add the ability to select multiple users and toggle their `Active/Inactive` status in one click.

## 3. Communication & Settings
- **Pinned Announcements**: Add a "Pin to Top" feature for important school-wide alerts in [admin-announcements.js](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/Educare%20Track%20-%20FINAL/js/admin-announcements.js).
- **Branding Settings**: Finalize the [admin-settings.js](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/Educare%20Track%20-%20FINAL/js/admin-settings.js) to allow updating the School Name and Address, which will then reflect automatically on all **Student ID cards**.

**Should I start with these Class Management and User Profile refinements?**
