## Phase 1 (Login → Role Dashboard)

- Added a simple Supabase client wrapper for sign-in, sign-out, and profile fetch.
- Built a minimal login page (user_id + password) that redirects to the correct role dashboard.
- Created role dashboards for admin/teacher/parent/guard/clinic with an auth guard and profile badge.

## Database Notes

- Updated the reset SQL so `profiles.id` matches the Supabase Auth user id.
- Added minimal RLS to allow users to read only their own `profiles` row.
