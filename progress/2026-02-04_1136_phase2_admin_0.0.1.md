## Phase 2 – Admin 0.0.1

- Extended the database SQL with announcements and password reset requests tables, plus admin-focused RLS and grants.
- Built an Admin module UI (sidebar + pages): Dashboard, Users, Classes, Attendance, ID Cards, Announcements, Calendar, Settings.
- Dashboard shows real Supabase data only (counts, alerts, announcements) and uses empty states when no data exists.
- Added a printable 2x3 ID card page that renders QR codes from `student_ids`.
- Added a Python analytics script that generates `exports/dashboard_metrics.json` and `exports/attendance_export.csv` using real Supabase data.
